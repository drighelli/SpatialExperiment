Package: SpatialExperiment
Version: 1.9.5
Title: S4 Class for Spatially Resolved -omics Data
Description: Defines an S4 class for storing data from spatial -omics experiments. 
    The class extends SingleCellExperiment to 
    support storage and retrieval of additional information from spot-based and 
    molecule-based platforms, including spatial coordinates, images, and 
    image metadata. A specialized constructor function is included for data 
    from the 10x Genomics Visium platform.
